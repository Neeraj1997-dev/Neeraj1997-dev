 <h2 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Priya!</h2>

Have exposure♛ to building professional websites🖥 and front-end applications 💻. Experienced with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industries🏢 . Skilled in FrontEnd Technologies✍️ as React.js, Redux, EcmaScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flexbox, .GitHub, Net, SQL, and C# for web and window-based applications.

Apart from my professional journey, I am a learner📝 and enthusiastic to learn new tech. I have created 15+ mini & major projects💼 on Reactjs and other technologies. Also deployed and having live-hosted projects📽, checkout out my GitHub pages📒 or YouTube📲 channel for more details.

Also, I play a role as a Tech Panel 📈 at IBM apart from my existing role and responsibilities in the project. Getting an opportunity to interact with many people and sharing thoughts out of the box🗃.

Completed Bachelor of Engineer (BE-ECE) from LNCT, TOP college in Madhya Pradesh but a delay in the offer letter, so meanwhile upscaling my skills & received an offer from another MNC (Accenture) where no one placed at Accenture from my college again it's an achievement for me to crack the OFF-CAMPUS in Delhi.
